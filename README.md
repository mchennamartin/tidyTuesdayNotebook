**Tidy Tuesday Notebook**
This is my contribution to the Tidy Tuesday social data science project organized by the data science learning community (thank you!).

I am using this repository to practice my R data wrangling and visualization skills, and learn python and certain python packages. Folders with later dates will have much better code and plots as I learn. 
This project is meant to be a public notebook to document my progress. Please use at your own risk.
